            <p>Growing up, I used to watch my
            brother play games like World of Warcraft and League of Legends- I was probably an annoying little sister. Since then, they have
            become a frequent form escapism. Finding out that some people have created entire careers through playing games was intriguing, 
            although I don't think I would ever have the patience to do something like that.</p>
